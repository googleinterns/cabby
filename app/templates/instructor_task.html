        <p><b>Your task: </b>
            A friend of yours is at the location indicated by the green marker, 
            and you would like to meet your friend at the location marked in red. 
            You need to communicate the meeting location quickly, 
            so you must describe it precisely using only information about the meeting point 
            (e.g. that it is a "bicycle rental") and descriptions of a few significant landmarks that you are 
            familiar with (black markers), and that relate your friend's location and the meeting point.

                <li>Please mention at least once the goal based on the description.</li>
                <li>You may use cardinal directions.</li>
