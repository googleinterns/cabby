Once you get to John Street head northwest on John and you'll see that post office I was talking about and then Crunch Fitness right after that.","rvs_path":"data\/geodata\/manhattan_samples_v101.gpkg","rvs_goal_point":[40.7080502,-74.0064227],"key":"A3862RIFFUV14135U0MRQMUJ815LYJJWGAMJE8C29OVC3","region":"Manhattan","rvs_start_point":[40.7151986,-73.9916176],"landmarks":{"end_point":[[40.7080502,-74.0064227],"Crunch Fitness"],"start_point":[[40.7151986,-73.9916176],"gallery"],"main_pivot":[[40.7123016,-73.9987175],"St. James Church"],"main_pivot_2":[[40.7130265,-73.9979511],"Mariners Temple"],"main_pivot_3":[[40.7107166,-74.0038713],"Drumgoole Plaza"],"main_pivot_4":[[40.7117446,-74.0020267],"1 Police Plaza"],"main_pivot_5":[[40.714621,-73.9933657],"Museum at Eldridge Street"],"main_pivot_6":[[40.7116952733,-73.999456612],"Alfred E.
